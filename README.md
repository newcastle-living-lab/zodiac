# Messier

Repurposing existing technologies within the original Living Lab application, Messier (a set of 110 astronomical objectsvcatalogued by the French astronomer Charles in his Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles) extends the Living Lab platform to provide real-time e-deliberation. By creating projects and inviting participants, a Presenter has the ability to upload images - via screen grab, screen sharing, or copying and pasting - to create a boundary object upon which comments can be recorded by participants.
	
The outcome of this process, established initially in response to the requirement for consultation regarding Building Information Management systems, is both a record and artefact which can be used to discuss a variety of visual entities both in real-time and as a reflection of a deliberative exchange between stakeholders and communities.
